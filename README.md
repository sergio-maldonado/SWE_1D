# SWE_1D
This is a Shallow Water Equations solver (in 1D), which employs the HLL approximate Riemann solver.

The code is based on the HLL solver, as presented in Toro, E.F. (2001) <em>Shock-Capturing Methods for Free-Surface Shallow Flows</em>. Great Britain: Wiley. Bed friction is included via a semi-implicit method. The bedslope term is incorporated using the method described by Valiani and Begnudelli (<em>J. Hydraul. Eng.</em>, 2006, 132(7): 652-665). 

Matlab scripts are provided for setting up and visualising simulations.
